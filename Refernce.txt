******************************************************** Spring JPA **************************************************************
@Lob -> it is used specify for the CLOB and BLOB Objects. By default JPA/HIBERNATE have limitations on the string length. this annotation will prepare to expect large size.

In ase of @OneToMany, we have a property called mappedBy to specify where the property being used in the other table

For enumeration we have a annotation to specify it @Enumerated(value=EnumType.STRING)
By default EnumType is ordinal meaning it will store integers such as 1, 2, 3 instead of strings. if we specify strings it will store actual values

hibernate.ddl-auto has 5 options. which are
None- won't perform anything
validate - it will validate JPA Entities against Database entities
Update - it will update or run the DDL Commands if there is change in tables
Create - it will create the DDL commands
create-drop -> it will create and drop all the content at the time of DB Shutdown.

Spring-boot uses create-drop option for embedded Databases, for others it is none
